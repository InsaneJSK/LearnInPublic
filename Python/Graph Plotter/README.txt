This code has been written by Jaspreet Singh

2 types of graphs can be made:
-->Bar graph
-->Line graph

The following modules must be installed before running the code:
--> Pygal
--> Pillow (PIL)
--> lxml
--> webbrowser
--> tkinter

The file entered for data must be in ".txt" format where:
--> each line is a different set of data
--> each line is written like a list
--> the first element of the list corresponds to the header for that set of data
--> all other elements except for first should be either integer type, float type or NoneType

As an example for this ".txt" file, see "SAMPLE.txt" in the same directory.
